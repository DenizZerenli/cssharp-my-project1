# cssharp my project1
This is my first C# project that I created myself. I received help from GPT for code errors. The content of the code, which I spent 1.5 hours working on, is written in Turkish, meaning I own 90% of the code.My teacher was Murat Yücedağ.
Additional information: This is a project implemented in my store. In my project, you can purchase products such as shoes and computers and pay using one of the following payment methods; additionally, credit card installment payments are available. *Important: There may be some minor errors in my code; I apologize for this. Best regards, Deniz Zerenli*
